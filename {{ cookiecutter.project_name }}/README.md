## Deployment

This application can be deployed using three different methods which are described in the following sections.

In all cases, the application will not immediately start without errors because it needs to bec configured first.
This is done via environment variables.
See [Configuration](#configuration) for the list of available options.

### On Docker

A docker image is built automatically that follows the master branch of the repository.
It is available as `$TODO`.

The container will automatically generate and print required configuration secrets if they are not defined.
Take note of them and set them as environment variables.

### On Kubernetes

A kubernetes configuration is included in this repository as [kustomization](https://kustomize.io/).
```shell
# just render the config
kustomize build $TODO

# directly apply it to your existing cluster
kustomize build $TODO | kubectl apply -f -
```

The container will automatically generate and print required configuration secrets if they are not defined.
Take note of them and set them as environment variables via the generated configmap.

### On Baremetal from source

*Although this deployment works, it is not recommended. If you need to use a deployment without containers, you should serve this application via uwsgi, gunicorn or the like.*

To build the application from source, follow the following steps:
```shell
# get the code
git clone $TODO
cd $TODO

# install python dependencies
pipenv install --ignore-pipfile

# build the frontend
cd src/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_frontend/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_vue
yarn run build
```

To start it:
```shell
cd src
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py
```

## Configuration

The application is configured at runtime via the following environment variables:

| Name | Default | Description | Notes |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| BL_DB_PATH | *required* | Path to the database file. | In container based deployments this preconfigured to point to `/app/data/db.sqlite` |
| BL_SECRET_KEY | *required* | Django secret key. | It can be generated by calling `manage.py gen_secret_key`. In container based deployments this is done automatically. |
| BL_ALLOWED_HOSTS | *required* | List of hostnames which may be used when accessing the application. ||
| BL_SERVED_OVER_HTTPS | `false` | Whether the application is served over HTTPS. If enabled, automatic redirects and additional security measures are activated. ||
| BL_HSTS_SECONDS | `63072000` | If larger than 0 and `BL_SERVED_OVER_HTTPS` is true, HSTS is enabled with this configured value. ||
| BL_TRUST_REVERSE_PROXY | `false` | If true, headers set by a reverse proxy (i.e. `X-Forwarded-Proto`) are trusted. | Defaults to `true` for Kubernetes deployments. |
||
| BL_EMAIL_FROM | *undefined* | From email address to use when sending mails. ||
| BL_EMAIL_HOST | *undefined* | Host address of an email server. ||
| BL_EMAIL_PORT | `25` | Port address on the email host. ||
| BL_HOST_USER | *undefined* | Username used to authenticate on the email server. ||
| BL_HOST_PASSWORD | *undefined* | Password used to authenticate on the email server. ||
| BL_EMAIL_USE_TLS | `false` | Whether TLS (including STARTTLS) should be used on the email connection. ||
| BL_EMAIL_USE_SSL | `false` | Whether SSL should be used on the email connection. ||

## Software Architecture

The software ist composed of a *backend* and a *frontend*.
The *backend* is written as a Django application while the *frontend* is using Vue.js.

### Backend

The *backend* package is located directly in the [src](./src) folder.
It is in itself a rather simple django project composed of the five apps:

- *{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}* for general things like Django's *asgi* handler and settings.

- *{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_frontend* which contains the vue code and ties it into the Django project.
  For its own structure see the [Frontend Section](#frontend).


### Frontend

The *frontend* Vue.js code is located at [src/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_frontend/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_vue](./src/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_frontend/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}_vue).
The package contains its own *README* that explains the directory structure and how to interact with it.
